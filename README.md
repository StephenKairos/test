# Test Github Repo

## Purpose

I made this repo so I don't have to setup the usual Github Username and Email every time I use a new computer. This was useful when I didn't have a laptop to use during finals, and had to set up a library laptop quickly (it deleted user data and programs, when the laptop shut down).
